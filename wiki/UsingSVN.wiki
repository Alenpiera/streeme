Please read the following tutorial and get to know tortoise SVN  - it will show you the basics of checking out and updating.

the "URL of Repository" when used with tortoise is: 

{{{https://streeme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}}

Wherever you set the folder in step 2, make sure that your Apache configs know the directory name in the virtual host entries! For example, I store mine in D:/web/streeme.

Once downloaded, please continue with the [InstallingStreeme Installing Streeme Tutorial]

checking out svn on linux/osx is amazingly easy, if you can't see the image above, simply create a streeme folder in your /Users/your_username/Sites/ or ~/web/ folder. 

then run something like 
{{{
notroot@ubuntu:~/sites$ mkdir streeme
notroot@ubuntu:~/sites$ cd streeme
notroot@ubuntu:~/sites/streeme$ svn checkout http://streeme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk . streeme-read-only
}}}

It should checkout a bunch of stuff and you're ready to go! 

if you need to update later, just enter your streeme directory and type

{{{svn up}}}
