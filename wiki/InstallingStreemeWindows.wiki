#summary Web Server Installation on Windows
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This is the Windows install guide - if you're looking for other platform installation guides, please go back to the [InstallingStreemeStartPage start page of the installation]

Streeme requires the initial installation of a web server package before the script can operate. This method seems to work on Windows XP to Windows 7 x64.

==Installing the Web Server== 

[http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#641 Install XAMPP (EXE Version)]

There is a visual guide on the installation below the download.

===Install Services===

after installing, please go to C:\xampp\apache

run/double click {{{apache_installservice.bat}}}

then go to C:\xampp\mysql

run/double click {{{mysql_installservice.bat}}}

===Configure Passwords for XAMPP===

open a web browser and go to:

[http://127.0.0.1] or [http://localhost]

Click "Security" > [http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php]

Set a password to Mysql, phpMyAdmin and XAMPP 

XAMPP show tell you everything's secure!

==Configuring the Server== 

Now you've got your bare bones server installed, you'll need to make some edits to the config files before you can proceed. 

===Apache Configs===
The above guide will add apache in a modular setup - to enable/disable modules, you just copy/link from /etc/apache2/mods-available to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled. If you use a linux that doesn't have modules like this, please compile it with the right functionality:

 * add mod-rewrite    *required*
 * add mod-XSendFile  *optional* [http://www.screenage.de/blog/2008/02/22/libapache2-mod-xsendfile-processes-x-sendfile-headers-with-apache2/ link]
 * add deflate_module *optional*

choose the right timezone for {{{php date.timezone}}} flag in _etc/apache2/apache2.conf_ make sure your PC clock is the same region and time. 

create a virtual hosts:
It's highly recommended that you choose two *random unused ports* between 1025-9800 and replace the example 8095/8096 pairs. One port is for the media stream and another is for HTML and program communication. Also make sure your paths are correct!

_/etc/apache2/httpd.conf_
{{{
# This is the configuration for the streeme app communication path
Listen *:8095

NameVirtualHost *:8095

<VirtualHost *:8095>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# This is the configuration for the music streamer
Listen *:8096

NameVirtualHost *:8096

<VirtualHost *:8096>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

#Disable SVN directory sniffing through apache
<Directory ~ ".*\.svn"> 
Order allow,deny 
Deny from all 
Satisfy All 
</Directory> 
}}}

now validate you've made the correct changes by typing:

{{{apache2ctl configtest}}}

if all looks good, go ahead and restart apache, type:

{{{/etc/init.d/apache2 restart}}} 

===PHP Configs===

_/etc/php5/apache/php.ini_ = the apache version
AND
_/etc/php5/cli/php.ini_ = the command line version 

 * set {{{magic_quotes_gpc = Off}}}
 * set {{{short_open_tag = Off}}}
 * set {{{memory_limit = 128M}}} or higher  

install PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository)

{{{sudo apt-get install php-pear}}}

once installed use the pear package manager to install apc and http_download
 * {{{sudo pear install APC}}}
 * {{{sudo pear install HTTP_Download}}}

install curl - required for cloudfusion:

{{{sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl}}} 

PHP MUST BE PART OF YOUR PATH! You'll know it's working if you type php on the command line and something starts happening rather than nothing happening :) 

===MySQL Configs===

You will have already set up your MySQL installation previous steps, but there's a couple of easy performance and internationalization tweaks to perform.

_/etc/my.cnf_
{{{
[mysqld]
default-character-set = utf8
default-collation = utf8_unicode_ci
query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_size  = 32M
}}}

===FFMPEG===
In order to do almost anything in this app on linux, you're going to need something like medibuntu - most importantly FFMPEG. You'll want to add the non-free versions to support MP3 appropriately. Read more about getting medibuntu set up here:

===Cleaning Up===

Restart both apache and mysql before you continue:
 
 * {{{/etc/init.d/apache2 restart}}} 
 * {{{/etc/init.d/mysql restart}}}
