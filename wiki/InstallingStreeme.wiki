= Introduction =

It's time to install the streeme application - most of this is configuration, so just go through and see what parts you'll need in your app.


== Check out the Code ==
use SVN to checkout the code from Google code. If you know how to use SVN, run the following command in your streeme directory:

{{{svn checkout http://streeme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ streeme-read-only}}}

[UsingSVN Help! I've never done this before - show me what to do!]


== Configure Streeme == 

in _your_streeme_dir/config/_
rename databases.template.yml to databases.yml
edit this file with a text editor
{{{
      username: your_mysql_username
      password: your_mysql_pass
}}}
