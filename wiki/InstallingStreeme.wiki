= Introduction =

It's time to install the streeme application - most of this is configuration, so just go through and see what parts you'll need in your app.


== Check out the Code ==
use SVN to checkout the code from Google code. If you know how to use SVN, run the following command in your streeme directory:

{{{svn checkout http://streeme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ streeme-read-only}}}

[UsingSVN Help! I've never done this before - show me what to do!]


== Configure Streeme == 

in _your_streeme_dir/config/_ 
 * rename databases.template.yml to databases.yml
edit this file with a text editor
{{{
      username: your_mysql_username
      password: your_mysql_pass
}}}

in _your_streeme_dir/apps/client/config_ 
 * rename app.template.yml to app.yml
edit this file with a text editor
 * iTunes XML Location - if you plan to use the itunes media scanner, enter the full path to your itunes xml file
 * Watched folders: if you plan to use the filesystem scanner to import your music, these are the folders that will be scanned periodically for new music - add a folder per line preceded with a "-" as shown in the example
 * If your music is predominantly stored on NAS drives on Windows, please remap the locations from the itunes style full paths to the windows style sharing paths using forward slashes only required for itunes scanning. examples given in file.


in _your_streeme_dir/_
 * rename .htaccess.template .htaccess
