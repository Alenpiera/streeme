#summary Web Server Installation on Linux
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This is the Linux install guide - if you're looking for other platform installation guides, please go back to the [InstallingStreemeStartPage start page of the installation]

Streeme requires the initial installation of a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) web server package before the script can operate. I would write how to do this, but there is much sager advice, better presented on Linux help sites - you'll need to find the right packages for your flavor of Linux - I'll be showing how it works on Ubuntu server, a popular and thin linux installation. I prefer Ubuntu over some of the other linuxes mostly because of Medibuntu, which offers some excellent multimedia and transcoding support.

==Installing the Web Server== 

please have a look at this wonderfully formatted and clear installation guide:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP

==Configuring the Server== 

Now you've got your bare bones server installed, you'll need to make some edits to the config files before you can proceed. 

===Apache Configs===
The above guide will add apache in a modular setup - to enable/disable modules, you just copy/link from /etc/apache2/mods-available to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled. If you use a linux that doesn't have modules like this, please compile it with the right functionality:

-add mod-rewrite    *required*
-add mod-XSendFile  *optional*
-add deflate_module *optional*

choose the right timezone for {{{php date.timezone flag}}} make sure your PC clock is the same region and time. 

create a virtual hosts:
It's highly recommended that you choose two *random unused ports* between 1025-9800 and replace the example 8095/8096 pairs. One port is for the media stream and another is for HTML and program communication. Also make sure your paths are correct!

_/etc/apache2/httpd.conf_
{{{
# This is the configuration for the streeme app communication path
Listen *:8095

# Be sure to only have this line once in your configuration
NameVirtualHost *:8095

<VirtualHost *:8095>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# This is the configuration for the music streamer
Listen *:8096

# Be sure to only have this line once in your configuration
NameVirtualHost *:8096

<VirtualHost *:8096>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

#Disable SVN directory sniffing through apache
<Directory ~ ".*\.svn"> 
Order allow,deny 
Deny from all 
Satisfy All 
</Directory> 
}}}

now validate you've made the correct changes by typing:

{{{apache2ctl configtest}}}

if all looks good, go ahead and restart apache, type:

{{{/etc/init.d/apache2 restart}}}
