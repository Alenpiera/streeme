#summary Web Server Installation on Linux
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This is the Linux install guide - if you're looking for other platform installation guides, please go back to the [InstallingStreemeStartPage start page of the installation]

Streeme requires the initial installation of a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) web server package before the script can operate. I would write how to do this, but there is much sager advice, better presented on Linux help sites - you'll need to find the right packages for your flavor of Linux - I'll be showing how it works on Ubuntu server, a popular and thin linux installation. I prefer Ubuntu over some of the other linuxes mostly because of Medibuntu, which offers some excellent multimedia and transcoding support.

==Installing the Web Server== 

please have a look at this wonderfully formatted and clear installation guide:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP

==Configuring the Server== 

Now you've got your bare bones server installed, you'll need to make some edits to the config files before you can proceed. 

===Apache Configs===
The above guide will add apache in a modular setup - to enable/disable modules, you just copy/link from /etc/apache2/mods-available to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled. If you use a linux that doesn't have modules like this, please compile it with the right functionality:

 * add mod-rewrite    *required*
 * add deflate_module *optional*

create a virtual hosts:
It's highly recommended that you choose two *random unused ports* between 1025-9800 and replace the example 8095/8096 pairs. One port is for the media stream and another is for HTML and program communication. Also make sure your paths are correct!

_/etc/apache2/httpd.conf_
{{{
# This is the configuration for the streeme app communication path
Listen *:8095

NameVirtualHost *:8095

<VirtualHost *:8095>
  DocumentRoot "/home/notroot/sites/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "/home/notroot/sites/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf "/home/notroot/sites/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"
  <Directory "/home/notroot/sites/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# This is the configuration for the music streamer
Listen *:8096

NameVirtualHost *:8096

<VirtualHost *:8096>
  DocumentRoot "/home/notroot/sites/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "/home/notroot/sites/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

#Disable SVN directory sniffing through apache
<Directory ~ ".*\.svn"> 
Order allow,deny 
Deny from all 
Satisfy All 
</Directory> 
}}}

now validate you've made the correct changes by typing:

{{{apache2ctl configtest}}}

if all looks good, go ahead and restart apache, type:

{{{/etc/init.d/apache2 restart}}} 

===PHP Configs===

install php5 cli 

{{{sudo apt-get install php5-cli}}}

_/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini_ = the apache version
AND
_/etc/php5/cli/php.ini_ = the command line version 

 * set {{{magic_quotes_gpc = Off}}}
 * set {{{short_open_tag = Off}}}
 * set {{{memory_limit = 128M}}} or higher  
 * set {{{extension=apc.so}}} if installing APC

Install XSL

{{{
sudo apt-get install php5-xsl
}}}

install PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository)

{{{
sudo apt-get install php-pear
sudo apt-get install php5-dev apache2-dev
}}}

once installed use the pear package manager to install apc and http_download
{{{
sudo pear install HTTP_Download
sudo pecl install APC
}}}

if you have problems with installing APC, please check [http://serverfault.com/questions/206633/failed-to-instal-apc-via-pecl-install-apc this guide] - some setups don't have all of the dependencies needed :/

install curl - required for cloudfusion:

{{{sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl}}} 

PHP MUST BE PART OF YOUR PATH! You'll know it's working if you type php on the command line and something starts happening rather than nothing happening :) 

===MySQL Configs===

You will have already set up your MySQL installation previous steps, but there's a couple of easy performance and internationalization tweaks to perform.

_/etc/mysql/my.cnf_
{{{
[mysqld]
default-character-set = utf8
default-collation = utf8_unicode_ci
query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_size  = 32M
}}}

===FFMPEG===
In order to do almost anything in this app on linux, you're going to need something like medibuntu - most importantly FFMPEG. You'll want to add the non-free versions to support MP3 appropriately. Read more about getting medibuntu set up here:

[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu Setting Up Medibuntu]

install the keys and repositories using that long commandline file then run this long commandline file: 

{{{
sudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/`lsb_release -cs`.list --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list; sudo apt-get -q update; sudo apt-get --yes -q --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring; sudo apt-get -q update
}}}

after discovery, type

{{{
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra-52
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg liblame0
}}}

===Cleaning Up===

Restart both apache and mysql before you continue:
 
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart 
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
}}}
