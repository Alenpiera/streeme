===Contributing Code===
If you want to contribute code to Streeme, there are a few things you can do to make the process flow smoothly.

Whether you're writing a new feature or fixing an existing bug, it pays to get a second opinion before you get too far. If it's a new feature idea, post to the appropriate streeme discussion group and propose it.

Not all bugs in our bug system are assigned, but if the one you're interested in fixing is, send a note to the person it's assigned to and ask if they would like a patch.
Behavior changes and anything nontrivial (i.e. anything other than simple cleanups and style fixes) should generally be tracked in the bug system. Please file a bug (Chromium | Chromium OS) and describe what you're doing if there isn't one already.

===Get your code ready===

 * Code must conform to the [http://trac.symfony-project.org/wiki/HowToContributeToSymfony#CodingStandards Symfony Style Guidelines]: when in doubt, look at the examples in the lib/vendor/symfony dir.
 * must be tested, preferably with unit tests. 
 * Should be a reasonable size to review. Giant patches are unlikely to get reviewed quickly, so please do your work in small doses.
 * use classes and dependency injection whenever possible
 * Streeme is a TDD environment. When changing model classes and helper classes, run the unit tests on Postgres, sqllite and mysql data stores to make sure you haven't broken anything. Unit tests can easily be run by typing 
{{{
./symfony test:unit 
}}}
 * if you are making non trivial javascript commits, please test your changes as widely as you can:

Streeme should be tested for:
 * *Desktop*
    {{{
    OSX( Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
    WIN( Chrome, Safari, Opera, IEb9 and Firefox)
    iPad
    Linux( Firefox, Chrome )
    }}}

 * *mobile*
    {{{
    iPad
    iPhone (OS 4.x+)
    iPod Touch (OS 4.x+)
    Palm Pre( 1.4 series )
    Android( 2.2+ )
    }}}  


===Language Contributions===

Any users may contribute a language pack, please generate a language module for your language group using the following symfony command where xx is the lower case [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes ISO-639-1 language code]

{{{
./symfony i18n:extract client xx --auto-save
}}}
