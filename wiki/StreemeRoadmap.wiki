= Introduction =

Streeme is very much in its infancy and there are multiple new features that spring to mind. Release 1.0 has no solid deadline at this time, but it will likely be somewhere near summe 2011. The following lists details some key features and bundling deliverables for this timeline. If you think you can help with any of these features, please let the project owner know!


= Summary =

 * Implement a resume feature to support audio books and long mixes
 * Implement a fast forward method for browsers without HTML5 controls
 * Deliver better mobile support for the Android platform
 * Import podcasts
 * Import playlists 
 * Support other jukebox software lists
 * Create a Virtual Machine version of Streeme
 * Create Language Packs for Streeme

===Implement a Resume feature===
For users with FFMPEG installed, offer a feature to resume a song or audiobook from a specific position. This feature should record its position in the song database on a per song scope. The user shall be asked if they would like to resume or start from the beginning of the song or audio book. The player will check in at a regular interval on the current position in the file using a javascript/php interface.

===Implement a fast forward method===
For devices and browsers that support the HTML5 API, create a button to tell the playback agent to scan forward or back in preset intervals or implement a seek bar to seek through the file visually. 

===Better support for Android devices===
I lack the testing facilities for Android phones and the emulator seems to differ from real devices. If you have feedback on android or can help develop for it, please contact the project owner to be added to the commit group.

===Import podcasts===
Podcasts are traditionally downloaded to a user's computer and then synced to a device. I'd like to either support this facility completely wirelessly or make an automation that syncs a users podcast list automatically with their scheduled tasks.

===Import Playlists===
Many MP3s come with an M3U file and iTunes maintains its own playlist mechanisms, it would be nice to add an automatic import feature to merge predefined playlists with the current playlist system where possible.

===Support music importing from other Jukeboxes===
Ideally streeme should support any jukebox software for managing song lists. If you have a favorite library management software, please help develop or bug test an importer for other software packages.

===Create a Virtual Machine===
Exposing your server to the 'net carries a few risks and is inherently more difficult to support. Let's create a solid VMWare or
