= Introduction =

This project features a premade virtual appliance for Vmware that significantly reduces the time to install Streeme while suporting most of Streeme's core features. This manual covers the steps you need to take to install Streeme Home Server on any Windows or Vmware compatible linux distribution. StreemeHome Server is not compatible with OSX yet, so please follow [InstallingStreemeMac The Mac Install Guide]. If you use bootcamp, you can evaluate streeme on your Windows partition before installing more permanently.

= Installing Streeme Home Server =

*Step One*
 * [http://www.vmware.com/products/player/ Get a copy of vmware player - free download]
<br/>
*Step Two*
 * Download the [Streeme Home Server Virtual Appliance] and unzip it to somewhere safe 
<br/>
*Step Three* 

 * Double click or load ubuntu-server-10.04-i386.vmx in vmware player and hit start - when prompted, say you "copied it" and the appliance will boot to a login screen. 
{{{
login: notroot
password: streeme
}}}

 * Once you gain access, immediately type:
{{{
sudo passwd notroot
}}}
*Now choose a new password for your server* - make it over 12 characters, mix in a number and change the case. Alternatively you can change to [ssh with proper rsa keys] using the bundled putty or the ssh command on linux.

*Step Four*

Run these commands in order to upgrade and initialize streeme 

{{{
cd /home/notroot/sites/streeme
svn update
./symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load
}}} 

Now add your streeme users - do this for each of the devices (your phone, office, gym.. you name it) that will attach to your home server install

{{{
./symfony guard:create-user your_username your_password
}}}

Once you're done, clear the cache to add all the edits items you've just made

{{{
./symfony cc
}}}

Now Scan your music!

{{{
./symfony scan-media --type=filesystem 
}}}
